# converge.cv - XMTP v3 PWA Development TODO

## Project Overview
Building a Signal-like PWA for XMTP v5 messaging - local-first, installable, encrypted.

## Latest Updates (2025-10-29)
- [x] Direct DM creation via identifier: removed `canMessage` gate and now call `conversations.newDmWithIdentifier({ identifier, identifierKind: 'Ethereum' })` for addresses; preserves `0x`/checksum and fixes `invalid hexadecimal digit: "x"` errors.
- [x] Outgoing messages: fetch conversation by id before `send` and retry after a `conversations.sync()` if needed; sending now works for newly created DMs.
- [x] First‑connect sync: run `conversations.sync()`, `conversations.syncAll()`, and a history backfill pass before starting `streamAllMessages()` so prior messages appear on first load.
- [x] Installations: added Force Network Refresh + Fetch Statuses actions, fetch via `client.preferences.inboxState(true)` when connected and via `Utils` when not; added timeouts and improved types.
- [x] Clear All Data expanded: disconnect wagmi wallet, close XMTP client, clear Dexie tables and XMTP OPFS DBs, purge SW caches, then hard reload.
- [x] Debug: new Web Workers panel with live worker tracking and Service Worker management; initialized worker tracker early and resolved TS typings.
- [x] Telemetry: disabled structured/perf/debug telemetry and reduced logging level for production client options.
- [x] Scripts: added `check_deploy.sh` to watch GitHub Pages deployments with `gh`.
- [x] Misc: refreshed theme palette and cleaned up lints/unused assets; dynamic SDK version shown in logs.

## Latest Updates (2025-10-28)
- [x] Upgraded `@xmtp/browser-sdk` to 5.0.1 and aligned signer implementations with xmtp.chat.
- [x] Fixed `canMessage` to resolve inbox IDs for Ethereum addresses on first attempt.
- [x] Added `storage.clearAllData()` to wipe IndexedDB and XMTP OPFS databases during logout/reset.
- [x] Improved XMTP installations management UI with key package status visuals and better error handling.
- [x] Cleaned up unused assets and variables.

## Follow-ups From Recent Changes
- [ ] Add automated tests covering `storage.clearAllData()` to ensure Dexie + OPFS wipes stay intact.
- [ ] Add integration test for the `canMessage` + inbox ID resolution flow to prevent regressions.
- [ ] Document the XMTP v5 upgrade and new installation management tools in README.

## Current State Snapshot (2025-10-29)

**Authentication & Identity**
- One-click onboarding auto-generates an XMTP-ready wallet and registers on the production network.
- Optional wallet connection flows via wagmi v2 (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, injected).
- Vault stays unlocked by default; manual lock/logout lives in Settings.
- `Clear All Data` now wipes Dexie tables and XMTP OPFS databases.

**Messaging**
- XMTP v5.0.1 client streams conversations/messages in real time (send/receive ✅).
- Default contacts seed new inboxes; debug tab surfaces logs/state snapshots.
- New DM creation uses `newDmWithIdentifier` for Ethereum addresses; no pre‑check gate. SDK performs inbox lookup internally.

**Settings & Device Management**
- Installations panel lists all devices, fetches key package statuses, and supports per-device revoke.
- Watchdog detects UI thread stalls and reloads the PWA automatically.
- Debug console tab aggregates console, XMTP events, and runtime errors.

**PWA & Platform**
- Service worker + Workbox configured (install/update prompts currently disabled for debugging).
- COOP/COEP headers injected via the service worker to enable SharedArrayBuffer isolation.
- Vite build patched to bundle XMTP wasm worker assets after `pnpm install`.
- Web Workers debug panel lists active workers and allows SW management.

**Known Gaps**
- Delivery state UI, retries, and offline send queue.
- Device-level key encryption (private keys currently plaintext in IndexedDB).
- Multi-identity UI/IndexedDB schema, attachments, group chat support.
- Re-enable install/update prompts and document XMTP v5 changes in README.

## Current Sprint: Identity & Wallet Management (2025-10-28)

### Identity Manager in Settings
- [ ] Create IdentityManager component
- [ ] List all stored identities with address, inbox ID, installation ID
- [ ] Add "Switch Identity" functionality
- [ ] Add "Remove Identity" for each identity
- [ ] Show current active identity with badge

### Multi-Identity Support
- [ ] Update IndexedDB schema to support multiple identities
- [ ] Add identity list to auth store
- [ ] Implement identity switching logic
- [ ] Handle XMTP client reconnection on identity switch
- [ ] Persist active identity selection

### Enhanced Installations Table  
- [x] Fetch key package statuses for installations
- [x] Display validation errors in UI
- [x] Show expiry timestamps (formatted)
- [x] Add status badges (valid/expired/error)
- [x] Sort installations by creation date (newest first)
- [ ] Add "Revoke All Other Installations" button
- [ ] Replace browser `confirm`/`alert` flows with in-app modals
- [ ] Implement auto-reconnect flow after revoking the current device

---

## Documentation & References
- [x] Added XMTP_BASICS.md explaining identity, inboxes, and installations with links to official docs and xmtp.chat.
- [ ] Update README to reference the new debug Web Workers panel and installations tools.
- [ ] Add a short guide for `check_deploy.sh` usage in DEPLOYMENT.md.

## Testing Follow-ups
- [ ] Unit test: Utils-based inbox state fetch when disconnected (timeouts, errors).
- [ ] Integration test: New DM creation and first message send using `newDmWithIdentifier`.
- [ ] E2E: Clear All Data performs wallet disconnect, client close, DB + cache wipe, and reload.
