# Agents Context & Project Knowledge

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Future agents working on this project should READ THIS FILE FIRST and UPDATE IT whenever they learn something new about the project or user preferences.**

## Project Overview

**Converge.cv** - A Signal-like, local-first Progressive Web App for XMTP v3 messaging protocol.

- **Live URL**: https://converge.cv
- **Tech Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Storage**: Dexie (IndexedDB wrapper)
- **Messaging Protocol**: XMTP v3 (currently mock implementation)
- **PWA**: vite-plugin-pwa with Workbox
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (auto-deploy on push to master)

---

## Critical User Preferences

### 🚫 NO PASSPHRASES BY DEFAULT
- **User strongly prefers**: Zero friction authentication
- **Never require passphrases** for onboarding or regular use
- Passphrase functions exist (`createIdentityWithPassphrase`) but are NOT in the default flow
- Auto-generate wallets in the background - users should never manually enter Ethereum addresses
- **Exception**: Could add passphrase as an advanced/optional security feature if explicitly requested

### 🔓 NO VAULT LOCKING BY DEFAULT
- App should stay unlocked by default after initial setup
- Users can manually lock from Settings if they want
- Don't force lock screen on every app reload
- `checkExistingIdentity()` sets `isVaultUnlocked: true` automatically

### ⚡ ONE-CLICK ONBOARDING
- Current flow: Welcome screen → Click "Get Started" → Automatically create identity → Ready to use
- **No manual wallet address entry**
- **No passphrase setup**
- **No multi-step wizard** unless absolutely necessary

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Identity & Storage
- **Identities stored in IndexedDB** (via Dexie), NOT localStorage
- Wallet addresses auto-generated using `crypto.getRandomValues()`
- Private keys stored in identity record (would be device-encrypted in production)
- No vault secrets required for default flow

### Authentication Flow
```
Welcome → handleStart() → 
  Generate wallet (crypto.getRandomValues) → 
  createIdentity(address, privateKey) → 
  Store in IndexedDB → 
  Navigate to main app
```

### Key Functions
- `createIdentity(address, privateKey)` - Simple, no passphrase
- `createIdentityWithPassphrase(passphrase, address)` - Advanced option (not in default flow)
- `checkExistingIdentity()` - Auto-unlocks vault on app load

---

## PWA Features

### Install Prompt
- Component: `src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx`
- Shows on mobile: "Install Converge - Install the app for faster access and offline messaging"
- Remembers dismissal in localStorage (`pwa-install-dismissed`)
- Only shows once per device

### Update Notifications
- Component: `src/components/UpdatePrompt.tsx`
- Checks for updates every hour automatically
- Shows banner: "Update Available" with "Update Now" and "Later" buttons
- `registerType: 'prompt'` in vite.config.ts for user control
- Non-intrusive - users can dismiss and continue

---

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Messaging About Features
- ❌ DON'T say "Works offline" (confusing for messaging app)
- ✅ DO emphasize:
  - "End-to-end encrypted messaging"
  - "Your data stays on your device"
  - "No phone number required"
  - "Decentralized protocol"

### Onboarding Copy
- Keep it simple and welcoming
- No technical jargon about keys, encryption, etc.
- Focus on benefits, not implementation details

## Development Commands

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start dev server (port 3001 currently running)
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm preview          # Preview production build
pnpm test             # Run unit tests
pnpm lint             # Run ESLint
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript type checking
```

---

## Deployment

- **Auto-deploy**: Every push to `master` triggers GitHub Actions
- **Process**: Type check → Build → Deploy to GitHub Pages
- **Domain**: converge.cv (CNAME configured)
- See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for details

---

## Current State (as of this session)

### ✅ Completed
- Simplified onboarding (no passphrases, auto wallet generation)
- PWA install prompt with localStorage persistence
- Update notification system with hourly checks
- Vault unlocked by default
- Identity storage in IndexedDB
- Clean UI with proper feature messaging
- Floating debug log control (bottom-right) captures console output and surface state snapshots
- Default conversations seeded from `DEFAULT_CONTACTS` when a new inbox has no history

### 🚧 Mock/TODO
- XMTP v3 SDK integration (currently mock in `lib/xmtp/client.ts`)
- Actual message sending/receiving
- Proper wallet key derivation (currently random bytes)
- Device-based encryption for private keys
- Group chat support
- Attachments
- **Default Contacts/Bots**: `src/lib/default-contacts.ts` has placeholder addresses for suggested bots (Welcome Bot, Base Agent, ENS Resolver, etc.). Replace with actual XMTP-enabled addresses when available. Check:
  - https://docs.xmtp.org for official XMTP bots
  - https://base.org for Base ecosystem agents
  - XMTP community Discord/forums for verified bot addresses

---

## Testing Notes

- Dev server runs on port 3001 (not 3000)
- Browser testing done via Playwright MCP tools
- Clear IndexedDB with: `indexedDB.deleteDatabase('ConvergeDB')`
- PWA prompts only trigger on HTTPS or localhost

---

## User's Goals

User wants to enable:
1. **Create new identity from nothing** → ✅ DONE
2. **Message someone on the Base app** → 🚧 Needs real XMTP integration
3. Worry about connecting existing identities later → Deferred

Focus on **friction-free onboarding** for new users first.

## Instructions for Future Agents

### Before Starting Work
1. **Read this file completely**
2. Check `TODO.md` for planned features
3. Review `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` for technical overview
4. Look at recent git history to understand latest changes

### While Working
- Keep the no-passphrase principle in mind
- Maintain the simple onboarding flow
- Test changes in browser (localhost:3001)
- Check for linter errors after edits

### After Completing Work
1. **UPDATE THIS FILE** with new learnings
2. Add any new user preferences discovered
3. Document new architectural decisions
4. Update the "Current State" section
5. Note any new dependencies or tools added
6. **COMMIT AND PUSH** your changes to keep the knowledge base synced:
   ```bash
   git add AGENTS.md
   git commit -m "docs: update AGENTS.md with new learnings"
   git push
   ```

### Communication Style
- Ask clarifying questions if passphrase/security features are needed
- Default to simplicity and low friction
- User prefers direct implementation over suggestions
